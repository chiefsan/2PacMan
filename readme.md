# Here it is!

You can escape now, play with my feelings, creating a worst situation for me. But eppovum apdiyae irukadhu!
PLease don't think this fade away jsut like that. 

It is not private anymore. Things have come out.

You cannot escape seeing me, my friends, batch mates!
I am not like you selfish caring only abot me and talking lies. Truth does matter to me and truth always wins!

Before making certain statement you should have thought twice

I am feeling lonely(just think about this again)
I misinterpreted you ( I have proofs!)
Because of my health you helped (Again I have proofs!)

How can you accuse me so easily just for your well being?
if you hadn't accused me I would have left the situation right there. I respect your amma's words. I understand this is not the age for all this.
But simply accusing doesn't make sense! I wish I get some sort of explanation from you, on why did you do this. todsy be the last day. From tmrw it is not gonna work this way.

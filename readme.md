[Ms. Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man) is a 1982 maze arcade game. The game requires real-time decision making and not memorization. Without a natural end state, the game demands short-term planning and reactive skill. We implement an application of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for the game of Ms Pac-Man influenced by [this paper](http://repository.essex.ac.uk/4111/1/MontePacTCIAIG.pdf). 

The MS. Pac-Man simulator used in this is provided in [this competition](http://www.pacmanvghosts.co.uk/).
